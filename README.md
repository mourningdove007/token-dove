## Overview

**Token Dove** is an open-source, browser-based Solana wallet dashboard that allows users to connect their wallet and view recent on-chain activity. This project is designed to be **privacy-first and cost-free**, keeping all interactions in the user's wallet and browser.

This repository is the first step toward a broader vision: a **platform for in-browser NFT and token exchange**, especially for gaming applications, where users retain full control of their assets.
